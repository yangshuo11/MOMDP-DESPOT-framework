ROSPlan Framework
=================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/KCL-Planning/ROSPlan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/KCL-Planning/ROSPlan)

The main ROSPlan website and documentation is available here:
http://kcl-planning.github.io/ROSPlan/

The ROSPlan framework provides a generic method for task planning in a ROS system. ROSPlan encapsulates both planning and dispatch. It possesses a simple interface, and already includes interfaces to common ROS libraries.

### Installation

Get the prerequisites:

(for Kinetic)
```sh
sudo apt-get install flex ros-kinetic-move-base-msgs ros-kinetic-mongodb-store ros-kinetic-tf2-bullet freeglut3-dev python-catkin-tools
```
(for Indigo)
```sh
sudo apt-get install flex ros-indigo-mongodb-store ros-indigo-tf2-bullet freeglut3-dev python-catkin-tools
```
Select a catkin workspace or create a new one:
```sh
mkdir -p ROSPlan/src
cd ROSPlan/
```
Get the code:
```sh
cd src/
git clone https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/occupancy_grid_utils
git clone https://github.com/KCL-Planning/rosplan
```
Compile everything:
```sh
catkin build
```

### Running a demo with the turtlebot

The turtlebot demo is now a simple exploration mission. The turtlebot will visit randomly generated waypoints around a map.

The domain for this demo is in the `rosplan_demos` package, as `common/domain_turtlebot_demo.pddl`.

To run the demo first follow the installation instructions and quick-start guide for the Turtlebot Simulator and Gazebo:

[Turtlebot Gazebo](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_gazebo) 

[Turtlebot Simulator](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_simulator) 

Then source the ROSPlan workspace in two terminals.

*1.* In the first terminal, begin the simulation, rviz visualisation, and ROSPlan nodes using the `turtlebot.launch` from the rosplan_demos package:
```
roslaunch rosplan_demos turtlebot.launch
```

*2.* In the second terminal run `turtlebot_explore.bash`, a script which
- adds to the knowledge base the PDDL objects and facts which comprise the initial state;
- adds the goals to the knowledge base; and
- calls the ROSPlan services which generate a plan and dispatch it.
```
rosrun rosplan_demos turtlebot_explore.bash
```

You should see the following output from the script:
```
waypoints: ['wp0', 'wp1', 'wp2', 'wp3', 'wp4', 'wp5']
Adding initial state and goals to knowledge base.
success: True
success: True
Calling problem generator.
Calling planner interface.
Calling plan parser.
Calling plan dispatcher.
Finished!
```

The turtlebot will move around the waypoints, exploring the environment. You should see output in the first terminal, something like:
```
...
KCL: (/rosplan_problem_interface) (problem.pddl) Generating problem file.
KCL: (/rosplan_problem_interface) (problem.pddl) The problem was generated.
KCL: (/rosplan_planner_interface) Problem received.

```

# Approximate POMDP Planning Online (APPL Online) Toolkit

[Copyright &copy; 2014-2017 by National University of Singapore](http://motion.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

APPL Online is a C++ implementation of the DESPOT algorithm for online POMDP planning [1]. It takes as input a POMDP model in the POMDPX file format. It also provides an API for interfacing directly with a blackbox simulator. 

For bug reports and suggestions, please email <motion@comp.nus.edu.sg>.

## Download

Clone the repository from Github (**Recommended**):
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AdaCompNUS/despot.git
```
OR manually download the [Zip Files](https://github.com/AdaCompNUS/despot/archive/master.zip). For instructions, use this online Github README. 

## Installation

Compile using `make`:
```bash
$ cd despot
$ make
```

(Optional): If you prefer using `CMake` see the [CMakeLists](#cmakelists) section.

## Quick Start

DESPOT can be used to solve a POMDP specified in the **POMDPX** format or a POMDP
specified in **C++** according to the API. We illustrate this on the [Tiger](http://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/papers/aij98-pomdp.pdf) problem.


1.To run Tiger specified in [POMDPX format](http://bigbird.comp.nus.edu.sg/pmwiki/farm/appl/index.php?n=Main.PomdpXDocumentation.), compile and run:

```bash
$ cd despot/examples/pomdpx_models
$ make
$ ./pomdpx -m ./data/Tiger.pomdpx --runs 2 
```

This command computes and simulates DESPOT's policy for `N = 2` runs and reports the
performance for the tiger problem specified in POMDPX format. See [doc/Usage.txt](doc/Usage.txt) for 
more options. For more details on the POMPDX format, see [this page](http://bigbird.comp.nus.edu.sg/pmwiki/farm/appl/index.php?n=Main.PomdpXDocumentation.)

2.To run Tiger specified in [C++](doc/cpp_model_doc), compile and run: 
```bash
$ cd despot/examples/cpp_models/tiger
$ make
$ ./tiger --runs 2
```

This command computes and simulates DESPOT's policy for `N = 2` runs and reports the
performance for the tiger problem specified in C++. See [doc/Usage.txt](doc/Usage.txt) for more options.


## Documentation

Documentation can be found in the "[doc](doc/)" directory.
